Control Craft is a mod aimed to add more fine-controllable VS power sources, Handy VS utilities along with
ComputerCraft peripherals, hope to empower higher level of automatics and ease the burden of
designing complex self-control systems with physical blocks and lua scripts.

Currently, the mod is in very early stage of development, only basic implementations are done to achieve
the lowest functionality. Some features are purely experimental and may be removed in the future. Resources and assets
are mostly placeholders and will be replaced by better ones in the future.

A lot of implementations were done by referring Create, ComputerCraft and other open source mods, I'm still a starter of modding.
Feel free to post issues and suggestions on the GitHub repository, I'll try to fix and improve the mod as much as I can.
