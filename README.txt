Control Craft is a mod aimed to add more fine-controllable VS power sources, Handy VS utilities along with
ComputerCraft peripherals, hope to empower higher level of automatics and ease the burden of
designing complex self-control systems with physical blocks and lua scripts.

A lot of implementations were done by referring Create, ComputerCraft and other open source mods, I'm still a starter of modding.
Feel free to post issues and suggestions on the GitHub repository, I'll try to fix and improve the mod as much as I can.
